##ANA 515 SU22 - Assignment 3 - Week 6
  This file is the week 3 Assignment README file, rmd code, and Knit file of the ggplot scatterplot.
  
  I had some trouble with number 6, getting it to save as an updated dataset and not just "value" in the global environment.  I ended up using mutate() to save it as a new df.
  Number 10 also gave me some trouble fixing the scales of the x and y axis, until I realized it was saved as a character vector and not a numeric vector.  Then, it took me a bit to figure out how to save it as a numeric vector so it would plot correctly.
